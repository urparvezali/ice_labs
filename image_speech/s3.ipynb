    "### Real-Time Speech Recognition System\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a real-time speech recognition system using the `speech_recognition` library. The system captures audio input from a microphone, processes it, and converts it into text using Google's Speech Recognition API.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Components\n",
    "- **Microphone Input**: Captures real-time audio data using the `speech_recognition.Microphone` class.\n",
    "- **Recognizer**: The `speech_recognition.Recognizer` object processes the audio and performs speech-to-text conversion.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Noise Adjustment**: The system adjusts for ambient noise to improve recognition accuracy.\n",
    "- **Continuous Listening**: The system listens continuously and outputs recognized text in real-time.\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Handles cases where the audio is not understood or there is a request error.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Features\n",
    "1. **Real-Time Speech Recognition**: Converts spoken words into text as you speak.\n",
    "2. **Dynamic Energy Threshold**: Automatically adjusts to background noise for better recognition.\n",
    "3. **Pause Threshold**: Configurable pause duration to detect when the user stops speaking.\n",
    "4. **Keyboard Interrupt**: Allows the user to stop the recognition process manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Usage\n",
    "Run the code cell to start the speech recognition system. Speak into the microphone, and the recognized text will be displayed in real-time. Use `Ctrl+C` to stop the process."
